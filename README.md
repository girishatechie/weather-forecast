## WEATHER FORECASTING TOOL

This Project showcases a Weather Forecasting Tool, built using Python and Tkinter Library (GUI Toolkit). It involves the use of OpenWeatherMap API,
to fetch the Current Weather Location (Real-time) for a particular city, input by the user, and a Geolocation API, to retrieve the user's location/city based on their IP address.

### Usage of GitHub Copilot:
1. For helping with the usage of OpenWeatherMap API, to fetch the cuurent weather location, for a particular city. 
2. For Data Parsing, in order to parse the JSON Response, into a Python Dictionary, which is more readable and easy to interpret as well as extract city name, from.
3. For Error Handling: Printing the Appropriate Message, in case of an Error, when the Response Status Code is not 200.
